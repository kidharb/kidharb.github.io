I was born around the time the [Intel 80286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) was introduced. About 10 years later I was introduced to Windows 3.1. My first computer was a Pentium 1 75Mhz, 8Mb RAM and 540Mb HDD and our household finally connected to the internet with a 28.8K US Robotics Modem. I learn't about the importance of a MBR (Master Boot Record) after I erased the Windows 95 partition while trying to resize the current partition to make space for Slackware 3.1. In the early part of the century I built a Core 2 Duo PC, with the sole purpose of overclocking it. I am not sure if Engineering chose me or I chose Engineering, either way I ended up completing my Electronic Engineering degree in 2004. My first job was as an embedded developer for a set top box company. The platform was built with a [NEC EMMA2](https://www.electronicsweb.com/doc/nec-electronics-introduces-new-emma-chips-0001) MIPS chipset running [uCos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-Controller_Operating_Systems). I loved it. I would stay in the embedded world and PayTV for another 12 years until joining IT in the financial services sector. My hobbies include squash, amateur telescope making, astronomy, open source, embedded systems and Linux.
